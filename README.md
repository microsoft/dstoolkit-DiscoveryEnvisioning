# Introduction and Overview
To effectively adopt AI, business challenges need to be linked to use cases that address these challenges and add value. From these use cases are derived the business requirements and OKRs, which form a solution's foundation.

## The AI Engagement Cycle
In the AI era, we explore business challenges through a cycle of Generation, Review, and Refinement:
- Generate with Copilot.
- Review with your team.
- Refine with your stakeholders.
  
## AI Transformation: Discover & Define Use Cases 
Transforming your business with AI involves two phases: Discovery and Definition. 
Discovery Phase: Identify business scenarios and use cases that can address business challenges with AI and decide their priority. 
Definition Phase: Define the personas, requirements, and success criteria for the prioritized use cases. 
After these phases, you're ready to architect and implement a production-ready solution.
This document provides two Copilot prompts: Discover and Define. You can capture the Copilot output using PowerPoint templates or any documentation application of your choice.

## How to use the Prompts
Prompts are in the Word Document and you can use the provided PowerPoint Templates to capture the generated content.

## Instructions:  
-	> You must use Copilot in Windows (or Copilot Web), set to Web – More Precise.  
-	Copy either the Discover or the Define prompt and paste into Copilot (if you see an image below the text you pasted, delete that image).  The prompt is rules and task based.  Meaning you get to select what the prompt does and does not do.  You can also ask Copilot to do other tasks that are not in the list, but which are related to the content generated.
- **Discover***: 
  - Inputs: Requires your business name and a Business Process Challenge statement (and optionally a Business Scenario description).
  - Outputs: The output is a set of prioritized business use cases & requirements for one or more business scenarios.
  - Summary: The prompt generates multiple business scenarios and then allows you to explore and generate a point of view on any of the business scenarios so you can work with your stakeholders to prioritize.  The prompt then allows you to generate business use cases and requirements so that you can prioritize which use cases to focus on.  Copilot can also generate questions to help you explore the scenarios and use cases.  
- **Define**:  
  - Inputs: Requires your business name, a Business Process Challenge statement, the Business Scenario description, the scenario Problem Statement, the Use Case description and the list of Requirements for the Use Case.   
  - Outputs: The output is a completed BXT (Business, Experience, Technology) template and a set of OKRs for the business requirements. Copilot can also generate questions to help you explore the use cases, requirements and OKRs.  
  - Summary: The prompt focuses on one single use case & requirements (Business Scenarios usually have 3 – 7 use cases under them).  You can repeat this prompt for all the Use Cases that you have prioritized.  
-	Once Copilot has finished, you can select all the generated text and copy into the template slides or any documentation application of your choice.   If you use the templates, you can copy the discussion questions into the slide notes.
-	At the end of this document, you will find a Taxonomy section – you may find this useful as it defines business process challenge, business scenario and so on.
